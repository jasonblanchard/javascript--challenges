Calculate how much a lifetime supply of something is given a person's age and a max age of 100 years old (woo hoo!). 

Create a form on a Web page where a user can specify the unit (i.e. "boxes" or "noodles") and how much they will need per day. When they submit the form, it should show them how much of their unit they will need to have a lifetime supply.
