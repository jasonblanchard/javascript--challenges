Assume we have a class with Ralph, Zack and Tony. They all took a test and here are their test scores:

```
Ralph - 90
Zack - 80
Tony - 100
```

For each student, log to the console their name and the grade they got. The output should look like this:

```
Ralph got 90% on the test.
Zack got 80% on the test.
Tony got 100% on the test.
```
