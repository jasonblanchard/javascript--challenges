## JavaScript Challenges
Repository of challenges for practicing JavaScript

## Procedure
For each challenge, think through the problem in three steps:

1. **Pseudocode** - *What are the things we need or need to know about?*. Write it out in plain english, don't worry about syntax.
2. **Implementation** - *How do we start turning our pseudocode into actual code?* Go line by line and turn the concepts you wrote out into working JavaScript code. Sometimes you'll realize you left out some steps in the pseudocode. That's ok, add it in!
3. **Refactor** - *What can we clean up or abstract?*. Once it's working, see if there's any code that you can make simpler or more clear to another developer, or more concise with less code. Can you make it more efficient? Are there parts we can abstract for reuse later?
4.
